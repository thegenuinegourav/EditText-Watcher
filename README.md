# EditText-Watcher  
An Android App to check editText dynamically as soon as user is typing and correspondingly display message.  
It can be used in implementing runtime forms in an app.  
If it is helpful to you then follow me (you can give it a star too), I will make some more useful standard codes..  
Happy Coding :)
